# qubes-mirage-firewall

A unikernel that can run as a QubesOS ProxyVM, replacing `sys-firewall`.
It uses the [mirage-qubes][] library to implement the Qubes protocols.

Note: This firewall *ignores the rules set in the Qubes GUI*. See `rules.ml` for the actual policy.

See [A Unikernel Firewall for QubesOS][] for more details.

## Build

Clone this Git repository and run the `build-with-docker.sh` script:

    sudo yum install docker
    sudo systemctl start docker
    git clone https://github.com/talex5/qubes-mirage-firewall.git
    cd qubes-mirage-firewall
    sudo ./build-with-docker.sh

This took about 10 minutes on my laptop (it will be much quicker if you run it again).

You can also build without Docker, as for any normal Mirage unikernel;
see [the Mirage installation instructions](https://mirage.io/wiki/install) for details.

## Deploy

If you want to deploy manually, unpack `mirage-firewall.tar.bz2` in dom0, inside `/var/lib/qubes/vm-kernels/`. e.g. (if `dev` is the AppVM where you built it):

    [tal@dom0 ~]$ cd /var/lib/qubes/vm-kernels/
    [tal@dom0 vm-kernels]$ qvm-run -p dev 'cat qubes-mirage-firewall/mirage-firewall.tar.bz2' | tar xjf -

The tarball contains `vmlinuz`, which is the unikernel itself, plus a couple of dummy files that Qubes requires.
To configure your new firewall using the Qubes Manager GUI:

- Create a new ProxyVM named `mirage-firewall` to run the unikernel. (In Qubes 4, do this via the `qubes-vm-create` GUI.  Check "Provides Network" and uncheck "HVM".)
- You can use any template, and make it standalone or not. It doesn’t matter, since we don’t use the hard disk.
- Set the type to `ProxyVM`.
- Select `sys-net` for networking (not `sys-firewall`).
- Click `OK` to create the VM.
- Go to the VM settings, and look in the `Advanced` tab:
  - Set the kernel to `mirage-firewall`. (In Qubes 4, qvm-prefs --set vmname kernel mirage-firewall)
  - Turn off memory balancing and set the memory to 32 MB or so (you might have to fight a bit with the Qubes GUI to get it this low). (Qubes 4: qvm-prefs --set vmname memory 20, qvm-prefs --set vmname maxmem 20)
  - Set VCPUs (number of virtual CPUs) to 1. (Qubes 4: qvm-prefs --set vmname vcpus 1)

You can run `mirage-firewall` alongside your existing `sys-firewall` and you can choose which AppVMs use which firewall using the GUI.
To configure an AppVM to use it, go to the app VM's settings in the GUI and change its `NetVM` from `default (sys-firewall)` to `mirage-firewall`. Alternatively, you can configure `mirage-firewall` to be your default firewall VM. (Qubes 4: qvm-prefs --set mirageos netvm mirage-firewall)

For development, use the [test-mirage][] scripts to deploy the unikernel (`mir-qubes-firewall.xen`) from your development AppVM. e.g.

    $ test-mirage qubes_firewall.xen mirage-firewall
