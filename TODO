x dns itself: what to do when a dns server does not reply?
  ? nx domain - type of reply for domain does not exist - drop packet, error message should be different though
- need to change debug output to not refer to rule numbers -- the relationship between those and the GUI is basically unguessable
- tcp lookups
- too many tags - rules.ml / firewall.ml
- ipv6 (out of scope)
- make state of dns transactions more explicit
- attempt retries when DNS lookups fail? (if it's important the user will probably retry, which will make us retry automatically)
  - the log gets really spammy - maybe we should keep retrying, but not keep logging each retry?
