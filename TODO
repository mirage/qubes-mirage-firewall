- make state of dns transactions more explicit
- dns itself: what to do when a dns server does not reply?
  - nx domain - type of reply for domain does not exist - drop packet, error message should be different though
- cname / mxrecord need to follow indirection to resolve
- tcp lookups
- ipv6 (out of scope)
